WRECK MP3's
===========

WhyReEnCode-KAM-MP3s was written to create standard, Constant Bitrate (CBR) 
MP3's from mono and Variable Bitrate (VBR) MP3 files.  As the name eludes,
THIS PROCESS WILL DEGRADE THE QUALITY OF YOUR MP3's AND SHOULD NOT BE DONE 
UNLESS THERE IS A REASON!

For myself, we were using a very nice, high-end DJ software that couldn't 
support mono MP3s.  As a programmer, I can appreciate the simplicity of 
programming an MP3 engine to handle only stereo, CBR files .  So rather
than beating my head against a brick and saying Why Why Why, I focused 
on identifying and reencoding the problematic files.

This proved harder than it might seem because:

	A) Who in their right mind would change a mono mp3 to stereo 
	   purposely?

	B) I didn't want to re-tag all the files with an ID3 tag

	C) I wanted the solution to work in Windows and Linux because I 
	   would use it in Linux but most people wouldn't.

After many iterations, I focused on a batch file creation utility that
would use standard command-line tools.  This allowed a run through to see
how bad everything was and then you can run the batch and walk away from
the computer for a day or whatever it takes.


INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Under Windows 2000, the ActivePerl and nmake15 in the contrib directory have
been tested and confirmed working.  


DEPENDENCIES

This program is written using Perl.  For Windows, this program has been tested
with ActivePerl-5.6.1.633-MSWin32-x86.msi under Windows 2000 with SOME testing
on Windows 98SE.

The current most tested version of ActivePerl is available at:
http://www.peregrinehw.com/downloads/ under the Perl Modules and Programs.

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  MP3::Info

This module also requires
  
  sox
  lame for Windows and notlame for Linux

Versions of the above that are tested and confirmed to work are included in the
contrib directories for both Linux and windows.  

*NOTE*: Lame.exe/notlame and Sox.exe/sox *must* be in the PATH!! 


RUNNING THE PROGRAM

For Linux, the program will be installed in /usr/local/bin.  To run it, either
have /usr/local/bin in the path or run:

	/usr/local/bin/make_batch --path-to-mp3s=<path_to_mp3_files> --batch-file=<batch-file to output> [--overwrite --verbose]

For Windows, the program will be installed in C:\utils\. To run it, either have
/usr/local/bin in the path or run:
	
	C:\utils\make_batch.pl --path-to-mp3s=<path_to_mp3_files> --batch-file=<batch-file to output> [--overwrite --verbose]

Under Windows 98SE, you may have to execute the program using something similar to:

  c:\perl\bin\perl c:\utils\make_batch.pl --path-to-mp3s=<path_to_mp3_files> --batch-file=<batch-file to output> [--overwrite --verbose]

When you are done, a batch file will be created that will:

A) Create a Backup of the original MP3
B) Convert the MP3 to WAV
C) Convert the WAV to Stereo [if necessary]
D) Convert the WAV to MP3
E) Add the tag from the original MP3 to the new MP3 as closely as we can

In windows, simple enter the name of the batch file to run it.  In Linux, 
type 'source <batch-file.bat>'.


CONVERSION SPECIFICATIONS

Mono CBR MP3s are converted to High Quality Joint-Stereo CBR MP3s at the 
lowest bitrate below or equal to twice the original bitrate

Mono VBR MP3s are converted to High Quality Joint-Stereo CBR MP3s at the 
lowest bitrate below or equal to twice the original average bitrate

Stereo VBR MP3s are converted to High Quality Joint-Stereo CBR MP3s at 
the original average bitrate


THINGS TO DO

Write a test procedure.
  To do this, I need to learn how to write a test procedure.  Comments and 
  input welcome.

Allow the exclusion of Hidden files under Win32 Systems.
  The code to do this is buggy and requires a full path.


ERRORS
  
  This error is "normal" on Windows Systems when converting VBR MP3s:
    Could Not Find test_stereo_vbr.1.wav
